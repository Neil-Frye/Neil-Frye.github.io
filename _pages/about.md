        <blockquote>"I had the pleasure of being Neil's manager for 5 years as he led the Business Intelligence & Analytics team at Mavenlink and, subsequently, Kantata. Neil was not only highly skilled in the tactical aspects of his role, delivering solutions to complex business requirements, but he also demonstrated his strategic mindset by consistently driving the team forward with new offerings and capabilities. Neil is a superlative manager of people. He connects with his team members fostering trust not only in his relationships but in the relationships within the team. He is adept at balancing the needs of those he manages with the needs of the company. At Mavenlink and Kantata, Neil oversaw a period of accelerated growth and did so with a high rate of employee retention. He was called upon, during the merger that resulted in the creation of Kantata, to create a new set of offerings for a completely new product line, and the result not only provided new client capabilities but also new revenue streams. Neil was a leader who I trusted and relied upon to help grow our business and serve our clients, and I would strongly recommend him as a leader in Professional Services."</blockquote>

Throughout my work with Neil, he taught me more about the business intelligence tools we used and guided me through complex metric creation and analytics testing. He is very patient and easy to work with, always willing to discuss shared objectives and how to meet client needs. He has great leadership abilities and served as a mentor to me during my early years as a business intelligence analyst. I would recommend Neil to any team that needs an effective leader and analytical thinker."</blockquote>

        <blockquote>"I worked under Neil's leadership for over a year as a Business Intelligence Consultant at Kantata when he was the Director of the Professional Services. During this time, I saw him mentor many consultants and professionals into management roles. He built many efficiencies into the professional services team, especially around client satisfaction and expectation setting. Neil used his prior experiences to become more efficient as a consultant, manager and mentor. He was open to feedback and solution oriented while also encouraging subordinates to maintain a work-life balance. As a result of Neil's effective leadership and efficiency, the professional services teams were able to employ a number of processes that helped the team build repeatable processes and tools that contributed to project success and billability. Neil's solution oriented approach to leadership empowered his subordinates to think outside of the box to find creative solutions to process questions and motivated them to go the extra mile for the success of the team. Under Neil's guidance, I developed the tools and confidence to stretch my skillset as a business consultant."</blockquote>
