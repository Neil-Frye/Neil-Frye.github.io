Running a global professional services organization isn't just about checking boxes—it's about building a strategic engine that drives customer success and sustainable growth. At Stripe, I had the unique opportunity to lead a global Strategy & Operations team across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Each region came with its own challenges, but I thrive in environments where I can step back to see the macro picture and then drill into the details.

## Seeing the Macro to Drive Micro Execution

When hundreds of millions of dollars are on the line, a one-size-fits-all approach won't cut it. Instead, professional services leaders need to blend data with intuition. My approach at Stripe was straightforward:

- **Build a framework** that integrates operational metrics with the flexibility to address regional nuances
- **Use integrated tools** to track everything from consultant utilization to project margins  
- **Create a single source of truth** to keep global teams aligned and agile

## Best Practices Rooted in Real-World Experience

My journey in professional services began long before Stripe. With over 500 client implementations under my belt, I've learned what works—and what doesn't.

### 1. Standardization Without Stifling Innovation

The key to scaling professional services is creating structure without rigidity:

- **Pre-defined service packages** help accelerate time-to-value for customers
- **Project governance frameworks** ensure repeatable success while allowing for customization where it matters
- **Robust methodologies** drive profitability without adding friction to the customer journey

In the SaaS world, where customer churn is a constant threat, ensuring a smooth, value-driven implementation isn't optional—it's essential.

## The Takeaway

A high-performing professional services organization is built on three pillars:

1. **Strategic alignment**—ensuring the team's objectives align with broader company goals
2. **Operational excellence**—standardizing processes while allowing flexibility for innovation  
3. **Cross-functional collaboration**—integrating seamlessly with sales, customer success, and product teams

When these elements come together, professional services become a strategic asset—not just a cost center.
